# Cat Detection Challenge

This repository contains the code and resources for the Cat Detection Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to develop a model capable of detecting cats in images.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and inference.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset.
- `models/`: Directory to store the trained models.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
- `images/`: Sample images and results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-detection-challenge.git
    cd cat-detection-challenge
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. **Model Training**:
    ```bash
    python src/model_training.py
    ```

3. **Model Inference**:
    ```bash
    python src/model_inference.py
    ```

### Notebook

The main notebook `Desafio_Gabriel_Fernandes_Carvalho.ipynb` contains the full workflow of data exploration, model training, and inference.

### Results

The `images/` directory contains sample images and the results of the cat detection model.
